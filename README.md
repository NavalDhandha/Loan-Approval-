To achieve this, team is gathering data on loan approvals from the past years.

Task 1: Visualize the data
CIBIL distribution between approved and rejected loans
Education distribution between approved and rejected loans
Income distribution between approved and rejected loans

Task 2 : Is there a relationship between income and loan amount for approved loans? Is loan amount directly proportional to annual income?
